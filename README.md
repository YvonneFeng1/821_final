## Descrption:

A graphical user interface (GUI) created as front end by connecting Redis that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. 

What is Redis? An in-memory database that persists on disk. Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. Redis can be classified as a tool in the "In-Memory Databases" category, while SQLite is grouped under "Databases". We choose Redus rather than SQLite.


## GUI Library System:
The tkinter package is used in creation of GUI.
