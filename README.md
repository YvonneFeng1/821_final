## Descrption:

A graphical user interface (GUI) created as front end by connecting Redis that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. 

What is Redis? An in-memory database that persists on disk. Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. Redis can be classified as a tool in the "In-Memory Databases" category, while SQLite is grouped under "Databases". We choose Redus rather than SQLite.

 This GUI first instructs the user to input the book features, then four options "Add book", "Delete book", "Edit book", "Search book" can be selected


 upload a .csv file containing a dataset with an outcome (y) and predictor(s) (x). The back-end code then read in the data. The next screen of the GUI then instructs the user of which variable is the outcome and which are the predictors. Next, the user selects the types of data (binary, categorical, discrete, or continuous) for each outcome and predictor. The GUI will then have different options for the tool to generate which the user can select through square checkboxes, including:
